# graphpocket
Predicting protein binding pocket similarity using graph neural networks.

Code to write:

- processing.py --> processing tough-m1 pockets to one hot encoded complex graphs
- model.py --> GVP implementation
- loss.py --> contrastive loss function (think of euclidean or RBF)
- train.py
- test.py
- scheduler?
